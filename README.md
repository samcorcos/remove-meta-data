# Remove PDF Metadata

This app removes PDF metadata. Pretty simple. It takes a file in, and returns a file that does not have metadata.

## TODO

Within `api/handler.js`, figure out how to remove PDF metadata within node.

Within `web/pages/index.js`, connect react dropzone to upload the file, process it, then download the file without metadata.
